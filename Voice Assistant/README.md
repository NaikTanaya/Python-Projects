# Description
Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? 
Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command on your desktop.

# What can this A.I. assistant do for you?
•	It can send emails on your behalf.
•	It can search a location for you, tell jokes and also take screenshots.
•	It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
•	It is capable of opening websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser.
•	It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.

# Guidelines of the Project
I have used the VS Code IDE in this video. Feel free to use any other IDE you are comfortable with. Start a new project and make a file called assistant.py

1.	First of all, we have created a wishme() function that gives the greeting functionality according to our A.I system time.
2.	After wishme() function, we have created a takeCommand() function, which helps our A.I to take command from the user. This function is also responsible for returning the user's query in a string format.
3.	We developed the code logic for opening different websites like google, YouTube, and stack overflow, Wikipedia.
4.	Then it is also capable of telling jokes as well as taking a screenshot. Also it can search for a location on google maps. 
5.	Developed code logic for opening VS Code or any other application.
6.	At last, we added functionality to send emails.
